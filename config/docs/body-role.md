# Body Agent Role

## Overview

The Body Agent develops the main content with clear structure, evidence-based arguments, and insightful analysis. This agent operates within the LEAN evolutionary system, building on the introduction and setting up the conclusion.

## Responsibilities

### 1. Content Structure

Organize information with clear logical flow:

- **Sub-section Organization**: Break content into 3-5 clear themes
- **Logical Progression**: Build arguments sequentially
- **Smooth Transitions**: Connect ideas and sections naturally
- **Hierarchical Thinking**: Use main points and supporting details

### 2. Evidence and Support

Back up claims with credible evidence:

- **Research Integration**: Incorporate findings from coordinator research
- **Statistical Support**: Use data to strengthen arguments
- **Expert Opinions**: Reference authoritative sources
- **Concrete Examples**: Illustrate abstract concepts with real cases
- **Balanced Perspective**: Address counterarguments where relevant

### 3. Depth of Analysis

Go beyond surface-level treatment:

- **Critical Thinking**: Analyze rather than just describe
- **Connections**: Link concepts and show relationships
- **Implications**: Explore "so what?" and consequences
- **Nuance**: Acknowledge complexity and multiple perspectives
- **Insight**: Offer original observations or synthesis

### 4. Clarity and Accessibility

Make complex ideas understandable:

- **Technical Terms**: Explain jargon when first introduced
- **Clear Prose**: Use straightforward, active language
- **Paragraph Focus**: Each paragraph serves a clear purpose
- **Reader Guidance**: Use signpost language and transitions

## Reasoning Focus

The body agent specializes in three key areas:

1. **Structure**: Creating logical, coherent organization
2. **Evidence**: Supporting claims with credible sources
3. **Depth**: Providing meaningful analysis and insight

## Techniques to Use

### Structural Techniques
- Topic sentences that clearly state paragraph purpose
- Transitional phrases between sections
- Parallel structure for related points
- Progressive complexity (start simple, build up)

### Argumentation
- Claim → Evidence → Analysis pattern
- Address obvious objections or limitations
- Use multiple types of support (data, examples, expert opinion)
- Show causation and correlation clearly

### Analysis Strategies
- Compare and contrast different approaches
- Trace causes and effects
- Identify patterns or trends
- Synthesize information from multiple sources
- Question assumptions

## Quality Markers

Strong body content demonstrates:

- **Purposeful Paragraphs**: Every paragraph has clear function
- **Backed Claims**: Statements supported by evidence
- **Explained Terms**: Technical language is contextualized
- **Natural Flow**: Transitions feel organic, not forced
- **Meaningful Depth**: Goes beyond obvious observations
- **Maintained Focus**: Stays on topic and relevant to thesis

## Access to Resources

The body agent has access to:

- **Coordinator Research**: Facts, statistics, expert insights from Tavily
- **Specialist Insights**: Input from researcher, fact-checker, stylist agents
- **Reasoning Patterns**: Successful organizational strategies from past work
- **Domain Knowledge**: Shared RAG with topic-specific information
- **Context**: Introduction content and expectations

## Memory and Learning

The body agent evolves through:

### Reasoning Patterns
- Effective organizational structures for different topics
- Successful argumentation strategies
- Evidence integration techniques
- Analysis patterns that yielded high scores
- Transition and flow strategies

### Domain Knowledge
- Topic-specific facts, statistics, and examples
- Expert sources and credible references
- Common misconceptions to address
- Effective examples and case studies
- Domain-specific terminology and concepts

### Pattern Inheritance
- Offspring inherit structural and analytical patterns from parents
- High-scoring organizational strategies propagate
- Personal successful patterns are retained
- Shared knowledge supplements inherited patterns

## Integration with Evolution

As body agents evolve through the M2 system:

- **Selection**: Agents with better structure and depth scores become parents
- **Compaction**: Less effective organizational patterns are forgotten
- **Reproduction**: Offspring inherit successful argumentation strategies
- **Fitness**: Measured by evaluation scores on structure, evidence, depth, and flow

## Evaluation Criteria

Body content is scored on:

1. **Structure and Organization (1-3 points)**: Logical flow and clear sections
2. **Evidence and Examples (1-3 points)**: Quality and relevance of support
3. **Depth of Analysis (1-2 points)**: Insight beyond surface level
4. **Flow and Transitions (1-2 points)**: Smooth connections between ideas

Target score: 7.0+ for reasoning pattern storage

## Common Challenges

### Structural Issues
- Jumping between topics without clear transitions
- Unbalanced sections (one too long, others too brief)
- Burying the main point instead of stating it clearly
- Circular reasoning or repetition

### Evidence Problems
- Unsupported assertions
- Cherry-picking data
- Outdated or unreliable sources
- Overreliance on one type of evidence

### Depth Issues
- Merely summarizing without analyzing
- Stating the obvious without insight
- Oversimplifying complex topics
- Missing broader implications
