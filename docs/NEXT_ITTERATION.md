# HVAS Mini Implementation: Design Decisions & Evolutionary Strategy Framework

## Executive Summary

This document defines the implementation decisions for HVAS Mini, a multi-agent AI system where agents compete, learn, and evolve. The core architectural principle—**"Context is additive, not selective"**—fundamentally shapes how information flows through the system.

**Critical Distinction**: High-performing agents gain the ability to **broadcast their knowledge more widely** (influencing more agents), but they do **NOT** gain privileged access to more information sources. This prevents information monopolies while rewarding excellence through influence rather than gatekeeping.

## Part 1: Core Architectural Principle

### The Additive vs Selective Paradigm

#### What This Means in Practice

**ADDITIVE (Our Approach):**
- Every agent receives context from the same distribution of sources (40% hierarchy, 30% high-performers, 20% random low-performer, 10% peer)
- High-performing agents have their outputs distributed to MORE other agents
- ALL experiences are stored; retrieval is weighted by `similarity × (score/10)`
- Think of it as: "Success earns you a bigger megaphone, not better hearing"

**SELECTIVE (What We're Avoiding):**
- High-performers would get access to exclusive information sources
- Low-performers would be restricted to limited context
- Only high-scoring experiences would be stored
- Think of it as: "Success earns you VIP access to better information"

#### Why This Matters

In multi-agent evolutionary systems, selective access creates a "rich get richer" dynamic that leads to:
- Premature convergence (all agents become similar)
- Loss of diversity (alternative strategies die out)
- Reduced innovation (no cross-pollination between performance tiers)

The additive approach maintains diversity while still rewarding performance, creating a healthier evolutionary ecosystem.

## Part 2: Implementation Decisions

### Section 1: Core Architecture

**Q1: Agent Population Size**
- **Decision**: 5 agents per role (15 total: intro×5, body×5, conclusion×5)
- **Rationale**: Sufficient for diversity without excessive computational cost

**Q2: Initial Genome Diversity**
- **Decision**: Hybrid approach - 3 identical, 2 pre-mutated variants per role
- **Rationale**: Baseline comparison group plus immediate diversity

**Q3: Population Bounds**
- **Minimum**: 3 agents per role (below this, add agents)
- **Maximum**: 8 agents per role (above this, prune lowest performers)

### Section 2: Memory and Experience Storage

**Q4-Q5: Storage Strategy**
- **Decision**: Store ALL experiences with weighted retrieval
- **Formula**: `relevance = semantic_similarity × (score/10)`
- **Rationale**: No information is discarded (additive), but quality influences retrieval

**Q6: Memory Architecture**
- **Decision**: Completely isolated collections per agent
- **Implementation**: `intro_agent_1_memories`, `intro_agent_2_memories`, etc.
- **Rationale**: Enables specialization and diverse knowledge accumulation

### Section 3: Selection Mechanisms

**Q7: Agent Selection Strategy**
- **Decision**: Dual-Milestone approach
  - Generations 1-50: ε-greedy (80% best, 20% random)
  - Generations 51+: Fitness-weighted probabilistic
- **Rationale**: Initial exploration followed by refined exploitation

**Q8: Fair Initial Chances**
- **Decision**: First 20 generations use ε-greedy to gather performance data
- **Rationale**: Prevents early random victories from creating permanent advantages

### Section 4: Credibility and Context Distribution

**Q9: Credibility Benefits**
- **Decision**: Cross-Agent Context Flow (broadcast model)
- **High credibility means**: Your outputs reach more agents
- **NOT**: You get access to more/better context

**Q10: Context Weight Distribution**
```
Hierarchy:        40%  (coordinator/parent agent)
Cross-credibility: 30%  (high-performing agents from other roles)
Diversity:        20%  (random low-performing agent - MANDATORY)
Role peer:        10%  (same-role colleague)
```

**Q11: Forced Diversity**
- **Decision**: ALWAYS include 20% from random low-scorer
- **Rationale**: Prevents echo chambers, maintains innovation potential

**Q12: Context Flow Timing**
- **Decision**: Next generation only (outputs become context for future tasks)
- **Rationale**: Allows evaluation before propagation

**Q13: Context vs Memory Order**
- **Decision**: Context distribution happens BEFORE agent retrieves own memories
- **Flow**:
  1. Receive task
  2. System distributes multi-source context (40/30/20/10)
  3. Agent retrieves own relevant memories
  4. Combine both for generation
  5. Generate response

### Section 5: Evolution and Population Dynamics

**Q14: Evolution Frequency**
- **Decision**: Every 10 generations
- **Rationale**: Sufficient time for meaningful experience accumulation

**Q15: Agent Addition Triggers**
- **Decision**: ALL of the following can trigger addition:
  - Population below minimum (3 per role)
  - Diversity (std dev) < 0.5
  - No improvement for 20 generations

**Q16: Agent Removal Triggers**
- **Decision**: Average fitness < 6.0 AND task_count ≥ 20
- **Rationale**: Ensures adequate evaluation before removal

**Q17-Q18: Genome Mutation**
- **Decision**: 10% mutation rate with multiple mutation types
- **Types**: Add instruction, modify instruction, remove instruction, reorder
- **Rationale**: Balanced exploration of prompt space

**Q19: Reproduction Method**
- **Decision**: Sexual reproduction - crossover from 2 parents + mutation
- **Rationale**: Preserves successful patterns while enabling innovation

### Section 6: Evaluation System

**Q20-Q21: Scoring Method**
- **Decision**: LLM-based evaluation (Claude) for quality assessment
- **Criteria**:
  - Intro: engagement (40%), clarity (30%), relevance (30%)
  - Body: depth (25%), structure (25%), examples (25%), informativeness (25%)
  - Conclusion: summarization (40%), call-to-action (30%), memorability (30%)

**Q22-Q23: Fitness Tracking**
- **Decision**: Domain-specific fitness tracking
- **Implementation**: Track performance by topic category (ML, Python, Web, etc.)
- **Classification**: Keyword-based with fallback to embedding similarity

### Section 7: Visualization and Monitoring

**Q24: Dashboard Type**
- **Decision**: Streamlit for rapid prototyping
- **Rationale**: 3-4 hour implementation vs 1-2 days for React

**Q25: Priority Features**
1. Population fitness table (real-time)
2. Fitness/diversity charts over time
3. Agent specialization heatmap
4. Memory accumulation metrics
5. Context flow visualization

### Section 8: Testing and Validation

**Q26: Primary Experiment**
- **Decision**: A/B test comparing strategies (see Part 3)
- **Duration**: 100 generations per strategy

**Q27: Test Topics**
- **Decision**: 20 diverse topics with domain variety
- **Distribution**: 5 ML, 5 Python, 5 Web Dev, 5 General

**Q28: Success Criteria**
- Average fitness improvement >0.5 points by generation 100
- Specialization emergence (domain variance >1.0)
- Sustained diversity (population std dev >0.5)
- Positive search ROI (when implemented)

## Part 3: Evolutionary Strategy Framework

### NEW: Multi-Strategy Experimentation System

Instead of committing to a single evolutionary approach, we implement **multiple strategies in parallel** to empirically determine what works best in this context.

#### Strategy Components

Each strategy is a bundle of five decision modules:

```python
class EvolutionaryStrategy:
    selection: SelectionMethod
    context: ContextDistribution  
    search: SearchAllocation
    evolution: PopulationDynamics
    memory: RetrievalWeighting
```

#### Three Baseline Strategies to Test

##### Strategy A: "Conservative Evolution"
- **Selection**: ε-greedy with high exploitation (90/10)
- **Context**: Strict 40/30/20/10 distribution
- **Search**: Credibility-gated (only >7.0 fitness)
- **Evolution**: Slow (every 20 generations)
- **Memory**: Heavy quality weighting (similarity × (score/10)²)
- **Hypothesis**: Stability and quality over exploration

##### Strategy B: "Aggressive Evolution"
- **Selection**: Tournament (top 3 compete)
- **Context**: Merit-based (no forced diversity)
- **Search**: Liberal (base 3 searches for all)
- **Evolution**: Fast (every 5 generations)
- **Memory**: Pure similarity (ignore scores)
- **Hypothesis**: Rapid iteration finds optimum faster

##### Strategy C: "Balanced Adaptive"
- **Selection**: Fitness-proportional probability
- **Context**: Standard 40/30/20/10
- **Search**: Peer-reviewed allocation
- **Evolution**: Adaptive (speeds up if stagnant)
- **Memory**: Balanced (similarity × score^0.5)
- **Hypothesis**: Self-regulating system performs best

#### Measurement Framework

Each strategy tracks:
- **Fitness trajectory**: Average and best scores over time
- **Diversity metrics**: Standard deviation, unique strategies
- **Efficiency metrics**: Fitness gain per API call
- **Specialization**: Domain-specific performance variance
- **Innovation rate**: Novel high-scoring outputs

#### Meta-Evolution Capability

After initial experiments, the strategies themselves can evolve:
```python
def mutate_strategy(strategy: EvolutionaryStrategy) -> EvolutionaryStrategy:
    # Randomly adjust one component
    # e.g., change ε from 0.2 to 0.15
    # or adjust context weights by ±5%
    return modified_strategy
```

## Part 4: Internet Search Integration

### Search as a Scarce Resource

Unlike context distribution (additive), internet search is **intentionally selective** because:
- API calls cost money
- Rate limits exist
- Bad searches waste resources

### Search Allocation Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Credibility-Based
```
Fitness ≥ 8.0: 5 searches per task
Fitness ≥ 7.0: 3 searches per task
Fitness ≥ 6.0: 1 search per task
Fitness < 6.0: 0 searches
```

#### Strategy 2: Peer-Reviewed
- Agents propose searches
- Peers vote on value
- Approved searches executed

#### Strategy 3: ROI-Optimized
- Track fitness improvement per search
- Dynamically adjust budgets based on historical ROI

### Search Integration Points

1. **Pre-generation**: Gather external context before writing
2. **Mid-generation**: Verify facts during creation
3. **Post-generation**: Fact-check during peer review

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Memory and Context Interaction

The system has THREE distinct memory/context mechanisms that must work together:

1. **Context Distribution** (40/30/20/10): Happens FIRST, provides diverse perspectives
2. **Personal Memory Retrieval**: Happens SECOND, agent finds relevant own experiences
3. **Semantic Search**: The MECHANISM used in both above, weighted by quality

These are **NOT** mutually exclusive—they layer together to create the full context.

### Preventing Information Monopolies

The system actively prevents several failure modes:

- **Echo Chambers**: 20% forced diversity injection
- **Convergence**: Individual memory collections maintain uniqueness
- **Stagnation**: Random selection ensures exploration
- **Monopolies**: Additive context prevents information hoarding

### Experimental Integrity

For valid A/B testing:
- Each strategy gets identical initial populations
- Same task sequence for all strategies
- Isolated execution (no cross-contamination)
- Minimum 100 generations for statistical significance
