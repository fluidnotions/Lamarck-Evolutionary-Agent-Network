You're absolutely right, and this is a **much better design**! Let me explain why your instinct is correct:

## Why Prompt Mutation is the Wrong Approach

### The Problem We're Actually Solving

The whole point of this system is that **prompts are terrible at encoding nuanced knowledge**. That's why we need RAG and memory systems in the first place! Trying to evolve "better prompts" is just perpetuating the original problem.

### Your Better Solution: Memory Inheritance

**Instead of mutating prompts**, you're proposing:
- Prompts stay stable (maybe minimal variation for diversity)
- Memories ARE inherited (compacted/distilled)
- Evolution happens through WHICH memories get passed on
- Natural selection determines which memory combinations work

This is actually how real evolution works at a deeper level - it's not about random DNA changes, it's about which accumulated adaptations survive.

## How Memory Inheritance Would Work

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, inherited_memories=None):
        self.dna = "stable prompt template"  # Rarely or never changes
        self.memories = inherited_memories or []  # Start with parent wisdom
        self.personal_memories = []  # Own experiences on top
        
    def reproduce(self, partner):
        # Compact/merge parent memories
        inherited = self.compact_memories(
            self.memories + self.personal_memories,
            partner.memories + partner.personal_memories,
            max_size=100  # Keep manageable
        )
        
        child = Agent(inherited_memories=inherited)
        return child
        
    def compact_memories(self, mem1, mem2, max_size):
        """Distill the most valuable memories from both parents"""
        combined = mem1 + mem2
        
        # Option 1: Keep highest-scoring memories
        sorted_by_value = sorted(combined, key=lambda m: m.score * m.retrieval_count)
        
        # Option 2: Cluster and keep representatives
        clusters = cluster_memories(combined)
        representatives = [get_centroid(c) for c in clusters]
        
        # Option 3: LLM distillation
        distilled = llm_distill(
            "Extract the key learnings from these experiences:",
            combined
        )
        
        return distilled[:max_size]
```

## Why This is Superior

### 1. **Preserves Learned Knowledge**
- Successful strategies get passed down
- Hard-won insights aren't lost each generation
- Knowledge accumulates over time

### 2. **Natural Selection of Ideas**
- Good memories lead to better performance
- Better performance leads to reproduction
- Bad memories naturally die out

### 3. **Avoids Prompt Engineering Trap**
```python
# Bad (prompt mutation):
"You are an intro writer. Use hooks. Be engaging. Start with questions. 
Make it compelling. Use statistics when relevant. Consider the reader's..."
# Gets worse and worse with each mutation

# Good (memory inheritance):
prompt = "You are an intro writer."
memories = [
    "Questions increased engagement by 31% on technical topics",
    "Statistics work best in second sentence, not first",
    "Personal anecdotes outperformed questions for emotional topics"
]
# Specific, tested, valuable insights
```

### 4. **Lamarckian Evolution** 
This is actually Lamarckian (inheritance of acquired characteristics) rather than Darwinian, and for AI systems, **Lamarckian is better**:

- **Darwinian**: Random mutations hope to find improvements
- **Lamarckian**: Successful learning gets passed on directly

## The Right Architecture

```python
class EvolutionarySystem:
    def __init__(self):
        # Prompts are essentially constants
        self.role_prompts = {
            'intro': "You write introductions.",
            'body': "You write body paragraphs.",  
            'conclusion': "You write conclusions."
        }
        
    def evolve_population(self, agents):
        # Evolution happens through memory selection
        successful_agents = self.select_by_fitness(agents)
        
        new_generation = []
        for parent1, parent2 in self.pair_parents(successful_agents):
            # Child inherits compacted memories, NOT mutated prompts
            child_memories = self.merge_and_distill(
                parent1.all_memories,
                parent2.all_memories
            )
            child = Agent(
                prompt=self.role_prompts[parent1.role],  # Same prompt!
                inherited_memories=child_memories
            )
            new_generation.append(child)
            
        return new_generation
```

## Memory Compaction Strategies

### Strategy 1: Score-Weighted Selection
```python
def compact_by_score(memories, target_size=100):
    # Keep memories that led to high scores
    return sorted(memories, key=lambda m: m.score)[:target_size]
```

### Strategy 2: Diversity Preservation
```python
def compact_by_diversity(memories, target_size=100):
    # Keep diverse memories covering different topics
    clusters = cluster_by_embedding(memories)
    selected = []
    for cluster in clusters:
        selected.append(cluster.best_example)
    return selected[:target_size]
```

### Strategy 3: Frequency-Based
```python
def compact_by_usage(memories, target_size=100):
    # Keep memories that were frequently retrieved and useful
    return sorted(memories, 
                 key=lambda m: m.retrieval_count * m.usefulness_score
                )[:target_size]
```

## This Solves the Real Problem

Your instinct is right because:

1. **Prompts are the PROBLEM, not the solution** - We use RAG because prompts can't hold nuance
2. **Evolution should work on what matters** - The accumulated knowledge, not the instructions
3. **Inheritance should be intelligent** - Pass on what worked, not random mutations
4. **Natural selection already handles optimization** - We don't need to also mutate prompts

The system becomes:
- **Stable interfaces** (prompts)
- **Evolving knowledge** (memories)
- **Natural selection** (fitness determines inheritance)
- **Knowledge accumulation** (each generation builds on the last)
