> There were some aspects of the framework which were a little bit fuzzy in terms of what the memories were, if they were content. Then it 
wouldn't really make sense because you couldn't apply them unless the content was related. And since this example writes multiple articles 
on different concepts, that made no sense. So I refined the concepts in the readme and I need you to update the coordinated plan in 
accordance with that and then figure out which branches are still valid. @README.md @docs/planning/CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md 
  ⎿  Read README.md (515 lines)
  ⎿  Read docs/planning/CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md (476 lines)

● I'll analyze the conceptual refinement in the README and update the CONSOLIDATED_PLAN accordingly, then assess branch validity.

  Key Conceptual Shift

  The README now makes a critical distinction:

  OLD (fuzzy): Memories = content/outputs that worked
  NEW (clear): Memories = reasoning patterns, not content

  Three-Layer Architecture (from README)

  1. Fixed Prompts (Interface) - Never changes
  2. Shared RAG (Knowledge) - Domain facts, available to all agents
  3. Evolving Reasoning (Cognition) - Planning strategies, inherited through generations

  Let me update the CONSOLIDATED_PLAN and assess branches:

       25    ## The Architecture (What We're Building)
       26    
       27 +  ### Three-Layer Separation of Concerns
       28 +  
       29 +  **This is the foundational design principle:**
       30 +  
       31 +  ```
       32 +  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
       33 +  │  Layer 1: Fixed Prompts (Interface)     │
       34 +  │  "You are an intro writer"              │
       35 +  │  - Never changes, never mutates          │
       36 +  │  - Stable behavioral interface           │
       37 +  └────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
       38 +                   │
       39 +  ┌────────────────▼────────────────────────┐
       40 +  │  Layer 2: Shared RAG (Knowledge)        │
       41 +  │  Domain facts, content, references      │
       42 +  │  - Available to all agents equally       │
       43 +  │  - Standard semantic retrieval           │
       44 +  └────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
       45 +                   │
       46 +  ┌────────────────▼────────────────────────┐
       47 +  │  Layer 3: Evolving Reasoning (What      │
       48 +  │            Gets Inherited)               │
       49 +  │  - Planning sequences                    │
       50 +  │  - Problem-solving strategies            │
       51 +  │  - Reasoning traces                      │
       52 +  │  - Retrieved by structural similarity    │
       53 +  │  - Per-agent ChromaDB collections        │
       54 +  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
       55 +  ```
       56 +  
       57 +  **Critical Distinction:**
       58 +  - **Layer 1 (Prompts)**: WHAT agents should do
       59 +  - **Layer 2 (Shared RAG)**: WHAT agents know
       60 +  - **Layer 3 (Reasoning)**: HOW agents think (this is what evolves!)
       61 +  
       62    ### Core Principles
       63    
       64 -  1. **Stable Prompts**: Genome (prompt templates) stays mostly unchanged
       64 +  1. **Frozen Prompts**: Interface layer stays completely unchanged
       65       - "You are an intro writer" never changes
       66       - Avoids prompt engineering fragility
       67 -     - Consistent behavior interface
       67 +     - Consistent behavior interface across all generations
       68    
       69 -  2. **Memory Inheritance**: Offspring inherit compacted parent memories
       70 -     - 50-100 inherited memories from parents
       71 -     - 50-150 personal memories from own experience
       72 -     - Total: ~100-250 memories per agent
       69 +  2. **Reasoning Pattern Inheritance**: Offspring inherit cognitive strategies
       70 +     - 50-100 inherited reasoning patterns from parents
       71 +     - 50-150 personal reasoning patterns from own experience
       72 +     - Total: ~100-250 reasoning patterns per agent
       73 +     - **NOT content**: Domain knowledge goes to shared RAG
       74    
       75 -  3. **Natural Selection**: Best performers reproduce, poor performers removed
       75 +  3. **Natural Selection**: Best reasoners reproduce, poor performers removed
       76       - ε-greedy, tournament, or fitness-weighted selection
       77       - Evolution every 10 generations
       78 -     - Add agents when diversity drops
       78 +     - Add agents when reasoning diversity drops
       79       - Remove agents when fitness < 6.0 (after 20+ tasks)
       80    
       81 -  4. **Context is Additive, Not Selective**: High performers broadcast more, but everyone receives equally
       82 -     - 40% from hierarchy (coordinator/parent)
       83 -     - 30% from high-credibility cross-role agents
       84 -     - 20% from random low-performer (forced diversity)
       85 -     - 10% from same-role peer
       81 +  4. **Reasoning Context Distribution**: Agents share cognitive traces
       82 +     - 40% reasoning traces from hierarchy (coordinator/parent)
       83 +     - 30% reasoning traces from high-credibility cross-role agents
       84 +     - 20% reasoning traces from random low-performer (forced diversity)
       85 +     - 10% reasoning traces from same-role peer

       112    
       113    1. START WITH INHERITANCE
       114 -     ↓ Already has 50-100 compacted memories from parents

       119 +     ↓ "How did I/my parents solve problems like this?"
       120    
       121 -  3. RETRIEVE MEMORIES
       122 -     ↓ Query own collection: inherited + personal
       123 -     ↓ Weighted by: similarity × (score/10)
       121 +  3. RETRIEVE KNOWLEDGE
       122 +     ↓ Query shared RAG for domain facts/content
       123 +     ↓ (separate from reasoning patterns)
       124    
       125 -  4. GENERATE CONTENT
       126 -     ↓ Stable prompt + retrieved memories + received context
       125 +  4. RECEIVE CONTEXT (40/30/20/10)
       126 +     ↓ Get reasoning traces from other agents
       127 +     ↓ (how they approached their tasks, not what they produced)
       128    
       129 -  5. EVALUATE (LLM scoring)
       130 -     ↓ Engagement, clarity, depth, informativeness
       129 +  5. GENERATE
       130 +     ↓ Fixed prompt + evolved reasoning patterns + domain knowledge + reasoning context
       131    
       132 -  6. STORE (ALL experiences)
       133 -     ↓ Add to personal memory bank with score
       132 +  6. EVALUATE (LLM scoring)
       133 +     ↓ Quality of output (engagement, clarity, depth, informativeness)
       134    
       135 -  7. EVOLVE (every 10 generations)
       136 -     ├─ SELECTION: Choose best agents as parents
       137 -     ├─ COMPACTION: Merge + distill parents' memories
       138 -     ├─ REPRODUCTION: Child inherits compacted knowledge
       139 -     └─ POPULATION MGMT: Add/remove agents based on performance

       136 +     ↓ Store planning steps + execution trace + score
       137 +     ↓ (NOT the content - that goes to shared RAG if needed)
       138 +

       184    
       185    ## Why This Design
       186    
       187 -  ### Problem: Prompts Are Bad at Encoding Nuance
       187 +  ### Problem: Prompts Are Bad at Encoding How to Think
       188    
       189    Traditional approach:
       190    ```python
     ...
       193    Use hooks. Be engaging. Start with questions.
       194    Make it compelling. Use statistics when relevant.
       195    Consider the reader's attention span...
       196 -  [hundreds of lines of instructions]"""
       196 +  [hundreds of lines of cognitive instructions]"""
       197    ```
       198    
       199 -  Our approach:
       199 +  Our approach (Three-Layer Separation):
       200    ```python
       201 -  # Stable prompt (simple, consistent)
       201 +  # Layer 1: Stable prompt (simple interface)
       202    prompt = "You are an intro writer."
       203    
       204 -  # Knowledge in memories (specific, tested, valuable)
       205 -  memories = [
       206 -      "Questions increased engagement by 31% on technical topics",
       207 -      "Statistics work best in second sentence, not first",
       208 -      "Personal anecdotes outperformed questions for emotional topics"
       204 +  # Layer 2: Shared RAG (domain knowledge available to all)
       205 +  shared_knowledge = ["WWII facts", "economic statistics", "historical context"]
       206 +  
       207 +  # Layer 3: Reasoning patterns (cognitive strategies, evolves through inheritance)
       208 +  reasoning_patterns = [
       209 +      {
       210 +          "planning_steps": ["establish_context", "add_statistics", "pose_question"],
       211 +          "execution_trace": "Used historical example → 3 stats → provocative question",
       212 +          "score": 8.5
       213 +      },
       214 +      # More cognitive strategies...
       215    ]
       216    ```
       217    
       218 -  **Key Insight**: That's why we need RAG in the first place—prompts can't hold nuanced knowledge. So keep prompts stable 
           - and evolve the knowledge base (memories) instead.
       218 +  **Key Insight**: Models don't think in text—they think in embeddings. Vector databases excel at finding similar reasoning 
           + structures. "Find planning sequences like mine" is exactly what embedding search was built for. So keep prompts stable, put
           +  content in shared RAG, and evolve reasoning patterns through inheritance.
       219

       220 +  ### Why Lamarckian > Darwinian for AI Reasoning
       221    
       222    **Darwinian** (biological): Random mutations hope to find improvements
       223 -  **Lamarckian** (AI): Acquired knowledge inherited directly
       223 +  **Lamarckian** (AI systems): Acquired reasoning strategies inherited directly
       224    
       225 -  For AI agents, Lamarckian is superior:
       226 -  - Direct knowledge transfer (no re-learning)
       227 -  - Faster convergence (start with inherited wisdom)
       228 -  - Preserves hard-won insights
       229 -  - Natural selection still applies (bad knowledge → poor performance → no reproduction)
       225 +  For AI agents, Lamarckian is superior because:
       226 +  - Direct cognitive transfer (no need to rediscover reasoning patterns)
       227 +  - Faster convergence (start with proven thinking strategies)
       228 +  - Preserves successful cognitive approaches
       229 +  - Natural selection still applies (bad reasoning → poor performance → no reproduction)
       230    
       231    Example progression:
       232 +  ```python
       233 +  # Generation 1 discovers through experience:
       234 +  personal_reasoning = {
       235 +      "pattern": ["establish_context", "add_statistics", "pose_question"],

       259    ## Implementation Status
       260    
       261 +  ### ⚠️ ARCHITECTURE CHANGE IMPACT
       262 +  
       263 +  **The shift from content-based memories to reasoning patterns affects most branches.**
       264 +  
       265 +  Key changes needed:
       266 +  1. Separate ChromaDB collections: agent reasoning patterns + shared RAG
       267 +  2. Store planning steps/execution traces, NOT content
       268 +  3. Context distribution shares reasoning traces, not outputs
       269 +  4. Retrieval queries reasoning patterns by structural similarity
       270 +  
       271    ### Completed (Merged to Master)
       272    
       273 -  ✅ **M1.1: agent-pool-infrastructure**
       273 +  ✅ **M1.1: agent-pool-infrastructure** - **STILL VALID**
       274    - `AgentPool` class managing 5 agents per role
       275    - Selection strategies: ε-greedy, fitness-weighted, tournament, best
       276    - Helper methods: `get_top_n()`, `get_random_lower_half()`
       277 +  - **No changes needed**: Population management is independent of what's stored
       278    
       279 -  ✅ **M1.2: individual-memory-collections**
       280 -  - Store ALL experiences (no score threshold)
       281 -  - Weighted retrieval: `similarity × (score/10)`
       282 -  - Inherited memory support
       283 -  - Per-agent ChromaDB collections
       279 +  ⚠️ **M1.2: individual-memory-collections** - **NEEDS REVISION**
       280 +  - Currently stores content/experiences
       281 +  - **Must change to**: Store reasoning patterns (planning steps + execution traces)
       282 +  - **Must add**: Separate shared RAG for domain knowledge
       283 +  - Weighted retrieval concept is still valid
       284 +  - Per-agent ChromaDB collections structure is correct
       285 +  - **Action**: Refactor to `ReasoningMemory` class
       286    
       287 -  ✅ **M1.6: tavily-web-search**
       287 +  ✅ **M1.6: tavily-web-search** - **STILL VALID**
       288    - Tavily API integration for external knowledge
       289 -  - Dynamic topic generation
       290 -  - Search result incorporation
       289 +  - **Purpose unchanged**: Provides domain facts for shared RAG
       290 +  - Dynamic topic generation works as-is
       291 +  - **No changes needed**: External knowledge gathering is orthogonal to reasoning patterns
       292

       366    
       367    ### Primary Outcomes
       368    
       369 -  1. **Fitness Improvement**: Average scores increase >0.5 points
       370 -  2. **Emergent Specialization**: Domain-specific variance >1.0
       371 -  3. **Sustained Diversity**: Population std dev >0.5
       372 -  4. **Memory Effectiveness**: Retrieval count correlates with performance
       373 -  5. **Strategy Winner**: One configuration significantly outperforms others (p < 0.05)
       369 +  1. **Reasoning Improvement**: Average scores increase >0.5 points through better cognitive strategies
       370 +  2. **Emergent Specialization**: Roles develop distinct reasoning patterns
       371 +  3. **Sustained Diversity**: Multiple problem-solving approaches coexist (std dev >0.5)
       372 +  4. **Pattern Effectiveness**: Retrieved reasoning patterns correlate with performance
       373 +  5. **Strategy Winner**: One compaction approach demonstrably outperforms others (p < 0.05)
       374    
       375    ### Observable Phenomena
       376    
       377 -  - Knowledge lineages propagate across generations
       378 -  - Memory accumulation (inherited + personal = 100-250 per agent)
       379 -  - Compaction quality improves over time
       380 -  - Cross-pollination from 20% diversity injection
       381 -  - Role-specific specialization (intro agents ≠ body agents)
       377 +  - **Reasoning lineages**: Successful cognitive patterns propagate across generations
       378 +  - **Pattern refinement**: Later generations have more sophisticated reasoning
       379 +  - **Cognitive accumulation**: 50-100 inherited + 50-150 personal patterns per agent
       380 +  - **Cross-pollination**: Diverse reasoning from 20% low-performer context injection
       381 +  - **Role specialization**: Intro agents reason differently than Body agents
       382    
       383    ### Failure Modes (What to Watch For)
       384    
       385 -  ❌ **All strategies converge**: Compaction approach doesn't matter
       386 -  ❌ **No generational improvement**: Later gens perform same as Gen 1
       387 -  ❌ **Memory bloat**: Inherited memories add noise instead of signal
       388 -  ❌ **Diversity collapse**: All agents become identical
       389 -  ❌ **No specialization**: Agents don't develop distinct knowledge
       385 +  ❌ **No reasoning improvement**: Cognitive patterns don't evolve
       386 +  ❌ **Pattern convergence**: All agents think the same way
       387 +  ❌ **Noise accumulation**: Inherited patterns add confusion instead of clarity
       388 +  ❌ **Diversity collapse**: Selection pressure eliminates alternative reasoning
       389 +  ❌ **No specialization**: Roles don't develop distinct cognitive strategies
       390    
       391    **Note**: Any failure mode provides valuable negative results. Adjust and retry.

       609 +  2. **Critical Insight**: We're evolving cognitive strategies (reasoning patterns), not content
       610 +     - Content goes to shared RAG
       611 +     - Reasoning patterns (planning steps + execution traces) get inherited
       612 +     - Models think in embeddings, not text
       613    
       614 -  3. **Next**: Complete M1, then proceed to M2 (memory inheritance/evolution)
       614 +  3. **Status**: M1 needs architecture alignment
       615 +     - M1.1 (agent-pool): ✅ Valid
       616 +     - M1.2 (memory): ⚠️ Needs refactor to ReasoningMemory + SharedRAG

     ## The Key Conceptual Shift
     ### OLD (Fuzzy)
     … +257 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! I've updated the CONSOLIDATED_PLAN and created a detailed analysis. Here's what I found:

  Key Conceptual Shift in README

  The README refinement makes a critical distinction:

  OLD (Fuzzy)

  - Memories = content/outputs (paragraphs, text)
  - Problem: Only applicable to similar topics
  - Didn't make sense for diverse blog posts

  NEW (Clear)

  Three-layer architecture:
  1. Fixed Prompts (Interface) - "You are an intro writer" - never changes
  2. Shared RAG (Knowledge) - Domain facts, available to all agents
  3. Evolving Reasoning (Cognition) - Planning strategies, inherited through generations

  What gets stored NOW:
  {
      "planning_steps": ["establish_context", "add_statistics", "pose_question"],
      "execution_trace": "Used WWII example → 3 stats → provocative question",
      "score": 8.5
  }
  # NOT the actual paragraph content

  Branch Validity Assessment

  ✅ STILL VALID (No changes needed)

  - M1.1: agent-pool-infrastructure - Population management is orthogonal
  - M1.3: fitness-tracking - Tracks output quality, not storage architecture
  - M1.6: tavily-web-search - Feeds shared RAG, purpose unchanged
  - visualization-v2 - Output visualization, independent of storage

  ⚠️ NEEDS REVISION

  M1.2: individual-memory-collections (MERGED - needs refactor)
  - Must rename MemoryManager → ReasoningMemory
  - Store planning steps + execution traces, NOT content
  - Create separate SharedRAG class for domain knowledge
  - FOUNDATIONAL: Other branches depend on this

  M1.4: context-distribution (needs update)
  - Must distribute reasoning traces, NOT content/outputs
  - Update AGENT_TASK.md before implementing
  - 40/30/20/10 distribution concept stays the same

  M1.5: pipeline-integration (major refactor)
  - Must implement 8-step cycle (README has new flow)
  - Add "Plan Approach" step (query reasoning patterns)
  - Separate "Retrieve Knowledge" (shared RAG) from reasoning retrieval
  - Store reasoning patterns, NOT content

  core-concept-refactor (review needed)
  - May be superseded by this README refinement

  Documents Updated

  1. CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md: Complete rewrite to reflect reasoning-pattern architecture
  2. REFINEMENT.md: New analysis document with branch validity assessment

  Recommended Next Steps

  Priority 0 (CRITICAL): Refactor M1.2 first
  - Everything depends on ReasoningMemory + SharedRAG
  - Update storage schema for reasoning patterns

  Priority 1: Update M1 branches
  1. M1.3 - proceed as planned ✅
  2. M1.4 - update AGENT_TASK.md, then implement ⚠️
  3. M1.5 - major refactor needed ⚠️

  The architecture is now much clearer: we're evolving cognitive strategies (how to think), not content (what to know).

> also keep this in mind 2. Implementation—how you’d actually get “thinking.”
A modern API call (say, OpenAI, Anthropic, or local LLM) doesn’t give you the internal reasoning trace of the model. It only gives you the 
final text output. You can, however, induce the model to externalize its reasoning by asking it to think out loud. That’s the basic trick 
behind reflection, chain-of-thought prompting, and “self-critique” loops.

A minimal architecture looks like this:

Step 1. Capture the reasoning trace.
You call the API with something like:

SYSTEM: You are a reasoning agent. When answering, include your reasoning under <think> tags and your final answer under <final> tags.
USER: How should we tune the retrieval threshold for noisy feedback?


The model might respond:

<think>
The task requires balancing recall and precision... a lower threshold risks pulling irrelevant cards...
</think>
<final>
Set the retrieval threshold dynamically based on rubric variance.
</final>


Everything inside <think> is your ephemeral reasoning trace.

Step 2. Extract and store that reasoning.
You parse the output, keep the <think> section, and bundle it with metadata:

{
  "situation": "tuning retrieval threshold under noisy feedback",
  "tactic": "dynamic thresholding by rubric variance",
  "reasoning": "The task requires balancing recall and precision...",
  "score": 0.87,
  "provenance": {"agent_id": "writer_01", "timestamp": "..."},
  "embedding": [ ... ]
}


That record—call it a reasoning unit—is what you index in a vector database.

Step 3. Retrieval.
Next time a similar situation arises, you embed the new context and search for semantically close reasoning units. You then compose the top
 k snippets back into the context for the next generation of the agent. This is exactly how retrieval-augmented generation works, but 
instead of external facts, you’re retrieving fragments of reasoning.

Step 4. Scoring and compaction.
After each task, you score the outcome (rubric, evaluator agent, or human) and update that unit’s score. Periodically you prune low 
performers, merge similar ones, or abstract a new one—hence the evolutionary feel. follow recommened steps 

● Excellent point! This is the practical implementation of the reasoning pattern concept. Let me update the CONSOLIDATED_PLAN to add this
  critical implementation detail:

       131 +  5. GENERATE (with reasoning externalization)

       150 +  ## Implementation: Capturing Reasoning Patterns
       151 +  
       152 +  **Key Challenge**: LLM APIs don't expose internal reasoning—only final outputs.
       153 +  
       154 +  **Solution**: Induce the model to externalize reasoning via structured prompts.
       155 +  
       156 +  ### Step 1: Capture the Reasoning Trace
       157 +  
       158 +  **Prompt structure:**
       159    ```python
       160 -  {
       161 -      "planning_steps": [
       162 -          "First establish context with historical example",
       163 -          "Then introduce 3-5 supporting statistics",
       164 -          "Finally pose thought-provoking question"

       168 -      "score": 8.5,
       169 -      "retrieval_count": 12,
       170 -      "generation": 5
       160 +  SYSTEM: You are an intro writer. When generating content, include your
       161 +  reasoning under <think> tags and your final output under <final> tags.
       162 +  
       163 +  USER: Write an introduction for "The Evolution of Understanding"
       164 +  
       165 +  CONTEXT (retrieved reasoning patterns):
       166 +  - "Start with historical example to ground reader"
       167 +  - "Use statistics in second sentence for credibility"
       168 +  - "End with provocative question to drive engagement"
       169 +  
       170 +  CONTEXT (shared RAG knowledge):
       171 +  - WWII computing history
       172 +  - Turing's work on machine intelligence
       173 +  - Modern interpretability research
       174 +  ```
       175 +  
       176 +  **LLM Response:**
       177 +  ```xml
       178 +  <think>
       179 +  The task is writing an introduction about AI understanding evolution.
       180 +  Based on past patterns, I should:
       181 +  1. Start with a historical anchor (Turing seems perfect given the topic)
       182 +  2. Add a statistic about modern AI interpretability research
       183 +  3. Build tension by contrasting past and present
       184 +  4. End with a question about future implications
       185 +  
       186 +  I'll use Turing's imitation game as the hook, cite recent interpretability
       187 +  progress statistics, then pose a question about whether machines can truly
       188 +  understand themselves.
       189 +  </think>
       190 +  
       191 +  <final>
       192 +  In 1950, Alan Turing proposed a test: if a machine could fool humans into
       193 +  thinking it was conscious, did the distinction matter? Seventy-five years
       194 +  later, as neural networks process billions of parameters, a new question
       195 +  emerges—not whether machines can think, but whether they can explain how
       196 +  they think. Can AI learn to interpret itself?
       197 +  </final>
       198 +  ```
       199 +  
       200 +  ### Step 2: Extract and Store the Reasoning
       201 +  
       202 +  **Parse and structure:**
       203 +  ```python
       204 +  reasoning_unit = {
       205 +      # Extracted from <think> tags
       206 +      "situation": "writing intro for AI evolution topic",

       208 +      "reasoning": "The task is writing an introduction... (full <think> content)",
       209 +  
       210 +      # Metadata
       211 +      "score": 0.87,  # From evaluator
       212 +      "provenance": {
       213 +          "agent_id": "intro_agent_2",
       214 +          "generation": 5,
       215 +          "timestamp": "2025-10-20T..."
       216 +      },
       217 +  
       218 +      # For retrieval
       219 +      "embedding": [...],  # Vector embedding of the reasoning
       220 +      "retrieval_count": 0,  # How many times this pattern was retrieved
       221 +  
       222 +      # NOT stored
       223 +      # "output": "In 1950, Alan Turing..."  <- Goes to shared RAG if needed
       224    }
       225 -  # NOT stored: the actual paragraph content
       225    ```
       226    
       227 +  ### Step 3: Retrieval by Reasoning Similarity
       228 +  
       229 +  **Next generation, same agent:**
       230 +  ```python
       231 +  # New task: "Write intro for quantum computing and consciousness"
       232 +  new_task_embedding = embed("intro for quantum computing consciousness")
       233 +  
       234 +  # Search by reasoning pattern similarity (NOT content)
       235 +  similar_reasoning = vector_db.search(
       236 +      query_embedding=new_task_embedding,
       237 +      filter={"score": {">": 7.0}},  # Only high-performing reasoning
       238 +      search_field="reasoning",  # Search the <think> content, not output
       239 +      top_k=5
       240 +  )
       241 +  
       242 +  # Returns:
       243 +  # - "historical anchor → statistic → tension → question" (score: 8.7)
       244 +  # - "provocative opening → credibility → intrigue" (score: 8.2)
       245 +  # - ...
       246 +  ```
       247 +  
       248 +  ### Step 4: Scoring and Compaction
       249 +  
       250 +  **After evaluation:**
       251 +  ```python
       252 +  # Update reasoning unit with score
       253 +  reasoning_unit["score"] = evaluator.score(output)  # 8.5
       254 +  reasoning_unit["retrieval_count"] += 1  # Track usage
       255 +  
       256 +  # Periodically (every 10 generations):
       257 +  # 1. Prune low performers (score < 6.0 after 20+ retrievals)
       258 +  # 2. Merge similar reasoning patterns (cluster by embedding distance)
       259 +  # 3. Abstract new patterns from successful combinations
       260 +  # 4. Pass compacted reasoning to offspring
       261 +  ```
       262 +  
       263 +  ---
       264 +  
       265 +  ## How This Differs from Traditional RAG
       266 +  
       267 +  **Traditional RAG:**
       268 +  - Stores: External facts, documents, knowledge
       269 +  - Retrieves: "What information is relevant?"
       270 +  - Example: Wikipedia articles, product docs
       271 +  
       272 +  **Reasoning Pattern Retrieval:**
       273 +  - Stores: Cognitive strategies, problem-solving approaches
       274 +  - Retrieves: "How did I solve similar problems?"
       275 +  - Example: "Use historical anchor → add statistic → pose question"
       276 +  
       277 +  **Shared RAG (Layer 2):**
       278 +  - Stores: Domain knowledge available to ALL agents
       279 +  - Retrieves: "What facts do I need?"
       280 +  - Example: Turing's work, interpretability statistics
       281 +  
       282 +  **Key Insight**: We're retrieving fragments of **reasoning** (HOW to think), not fragments of **knowledge** (WHAT to 
           + know). Models think in embeddings—vector search excels at finding similar cognitive structures.

       22    ### Example of What Gets Stored NOW
       23    
       24 +  **LLM Response with Externalized Reasoning:**
       25 +  ```xml
       26 +  <think>
       27 +  The task is writing an introduction about AI understanding evolution.
       28 +  Based on past patterns, I should:
       29 +  1. Start with a historical anchor (Turing seems perfect given the topic)
       30 +  2. Add a statistic about modern AI interpretability research
       31 +  3. Build tension by contrasting past and present
       32 +  4. End with a question about future implications
       33 +  
       34 +  I'll use Turing's imitation game as the hook, cite recent interpretability
       35 +  progress statistics, then pose a question about whether machines can truly
       36 +  understand themselves.
       37 +  </think>
       38 +  
       39 +  <final>
       40 +  In 1950, Alan Turing proposed a test: if a machine could fool humans into
       41 +  thinking it was conscious, did the distinction matter? Seventy-five years
       42 +  later, as neural networks process billions of parameters, a new question
       43 +  emerges—not whether machines can think, but whether they can explain how
       44 +  they think. Can AI learn to interpret itself?
       45 +  </final>
       46 +  ```
       47 +  
       48 +  **What gets STORED (in per-agent reasoning collection):**

  ⎿  Updated docs/brainstorming/REFINEMENT.md with 54 additions                                                     
        71    
        72    ---
        73    
        74 +  ## Implementation: The 4-Step Process
        75 +  
        76 +  **Key Challenge**: LLM APIs don't expose internal reasoning—only final outputs.
        77 +  
        78 +  **Solution**: Induce the model to externalize reasoning via structured prompts.
        79 +  
        80 +  ### Step 1: Capture the Reasoning Trace
        81 +  
        82 +  Add to system prompt:
        83 +  ```
        84 +  SYSTEM: You are an intro writer. When generating content, include your
        85 +  reasoning under <think> tags and your final output under <final> tags.
        86 +  ```
        87 +  
        88 +  Provide context from:
        89 +  - Retrieved reasoning patterns (from vector DB)
        90 +  - Shared RAG knowledge (domain facts)
        91 +  - Reasoning traces from other agents (40/30/20/10 distribution)
        92 +  
        93 +  ### Step 2: Extract and Store the Reasoning
        94 +  
        95 +  Parse the LLM response:
        96 +  1. Extract `<think>` section → this is the reasoning pattern
        97 +  2. Extract `<final>` section → this is the output (optional: store in shared RAG)
        98 +  3. Structure as reasoning unit with metadata:
        99 +     - `situation`, `tactic`, `reasoning`
       100 +     - `score`, `retrieval_count`, `generation`
       101 +     - `provenance`, `embedding`, `inherited_from`
       102 +  
       103 +  ### Step 3: Retrieval by Reasoning Similarity
       104 +  
       105 +  Next generation, similar task:
       106 +  1. Embed the new task description
       107 +  2. Search vector DB for similar reasoning patterns (NOT content)
       108 +  3. Filter by `score > 7.0` (only high-performing reasoning)
       109 +  4. Return top-k reasoning patterns
       110 +  5. Include in context for next generation
       111 +  
       112 +  ### Step 4: Scoring and Compaction
       113 +  
       114 +  After evaluation:
       115 +  1. Score the output (LLM evaluator: engagement, clarity, depth)
       116 +  2. Update reasoning unit's score
       117 +  3. Increment `retrieval_count` each time pattern is used
       118 +  4. Periodically (every 10 generations):
       119 +     - Prune low performers (score < 6.0 after 20+ uses)
       120 +     - Merge similar patterns (cluster by embedding distance)
       121 +     - Abstract new patterns from successful combinations
       122 +     - Compact and pass to offspring
       123 +  
       124 +  **This is the evolutionary loop**: Good reasoning patterns survive and propagate, bad ones get pruned.

       673    
       674    ### Priority 1: Update M1 Branches for Reasoning Patterns

● Excellent! I've integrated the implementation details into both documents. Here's what's been updated:

  Summary of Changes

  1. CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md - Major Updates

  Added "Implementation: Capturing Reasoning Patterns" section showing the practical 4-step process:

  Step 1: Capture the Reasoning Trace

  SYSTEM: You are an intro writer. Include reasoning under <think> tags
  and your final output under <final> tags.

  The LLM responds with:
  <think>
  Based on past patterns, I should:
  1. Start with historical anchor
  2. Add statistic for credibility
  3. End with provocative question
  ...
  </think>

  <final>
  In 1950, Alan Turing proposed a test...
  </final>

  Step 2: Extract and Store the Reasoning

  - Parse <think> section → reasoning pattern
  - Parse <final> section → output (goes to shared RAG if needed)
  - Store as structured unit with metadata

  Step 3: Retrieval by Reasoning Similarity

  - Search by <think> content similarity, NOT output content
  - Filter by score > 7.0 (high-performing reasoning only)
  - Return top-k patterns for context

  Step 4: Scoring and Compaction

  - Score output quality → update reasoning pattern
  - Track retrieval_count
  - Periodically prune, merge, compact, inherit

  2. Key Distinctions Added

  Traditional RAG vs Reasoning Pattern Retrieval:
  - Traditional RAG: "What information is relevant?" (facts, documents)
  - Reasoning Pattern Retrieval: "How did I solve similar problems?" (cognitive strategies)
  - Shared RAG (Layer 2): "What facts do I need?" (domain knowledge for all agents)

  What gets stored:
  - <think> → Per-agent reasoning collection (Layer 3: Evolving)
  - <final> → Shared RAG if needed (Layer 2: Fixed)
  - Prompts → Never change (Layer 1: Frozen)

  3. Updated Priority 0 (CRITICAL)

  Refactor M1.2 now includes concrete implementation:
  - Add <think> and <final> tags to system prompts
  - Parse LLM responses to extract reasoning
  - Store reasoning patterns with metadata:
    - situation, tactic, reasoning (from <think>)
    - score, retrieval_count, generation
    - provenance, embedding, inherited_from

  4. REFINEMENT.md Updates

  Added complete 4-step implementation process with the same detail as CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.

  The Complete Architecture Now

  Three Layers + Implementation:

  1. Layer 1 (Prompts): Fixed interface + <think>/<final> tags
  2. Layer 2 (Shared RAG): Domain knowledge from <final> tags
  3. Layer 3 (Reasoning): Cognitive patterns from <think> tags

  The Evolutionary Loop:
  1. Agent generates with <think> + <final> sections
  2. Extract <think> → reasoning pattern
  3. Score output quality → update pattern metadata
  4. Good patterns survive, bad ones pruned
  5. Offspring inherit compacted reasoning patterns
  6. Next generation retrieves parent reasoning patterns by similarity

  Next Steps (Recommended Order)

  1. Priority 0: Refactor M1.2 to implement <think>/<final> parsing
  2. Priority 1: Update M1.4 and M1.5 to use reasoning patterns
  3. Priority 2: Verify 20-generation test with reasoning inheritance
  4. Priority 3: Proceed to M2 (reasoning pattern compaction strategies)

  The architecture is now fully concrete: we know what to store (reasoning patterns), how to capture them (<think> tags), and why this
  works (models think in embeddings, vector search finds similar cognitive structures).
