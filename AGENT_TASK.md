# Feature: Business Rules Agent Enhancement
## Agent Implementation Task

## Objective
Enhance the Business Rules Agent with a powerful rule engine, LLM-powered rule authoring, and comprehensive rule management.

## Current State Analysis
Business rules agent exists with basic rule evaluation. This enhancement adds:
- Advanced rule engine with complex conditions
- LLM-assisted rule authoring
- Rule conflict detection and resolution
- Rule versioning and management

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Advanced Rule Engine
**File**: `src/validators/rule_engine_v2.py` (new)
**Features**:
- Complex boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
- Nested conditions with parentheses
- Custom operators and functions
- Rule templates and macros
- Performance-optimized evaluation

### 2. Rule DSL (Domain-Specific Language)
**File**: `src/validators/rule_dsl.py` (new)
**Capabilities**:
- Natural language-like syntax
- Type-safe rule definitions
- IDE autocomplete support
- Rule validation at definition time

**Example**:
```python
rule("minimum_age")
  .when(data.age < 18)
  .then(reject("Must be 18 or older"))
  .severity(ERROR)
```

### 3. LLM-Powered Rule Authoring
**File**: `src/agents/rule_authoring.py` (new)
**Features**:
- Convert natural language to rules
- Generate test cases for rules
- Suggest rule improvements
- Explain rule violations in plain language

### 4. Rule Management System
**File**: `src/validators/rule_manager.py` (new)
**Components**:
- Rule storage and retrieval
- Rule versioning (v1, v2, etc.)
- Rule activation/deactivation
- Rule dependency tracking
- Conflict detection and resolution

### 5. Rule Testing Framework
**File**: `src/validators/rule_testing.py` (new)
**Features**:
- Unit test generation for rules
- Coverage analysis (which rules tested)
- Rule mutation testing
- Performance benchmarking

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Test rule evaluation with complex conditions
- Test rule DSL parsing
- Test LLM rule generation (mocked)
- Test conflict detection
- Test rule versioning

### Integration Tests
- Test business rules agent in workflow
- Test with large rule sets (100+ rules)
- Test rule dependencies
- Test performance under load

### Rule-Specific Tests
- Generate test cases for each rule
- Test edge cases
- Test rule interactions
- Test backwards compatibility

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Rule engine evaluates 1000+ rules in <10ms
- ✅ Rule DSL is intuitive and type-safe
- ✅ LLM generates valid rules 85%+ of the time
- ✅ Conflict detection finds all conflicts
- ✅ All tests passing with >85% coverage

## Implementation Steps

1. Design advanced rule engine architecture
2. Implement rule DSL with parser
3. Build LLM rule authoring system
4. Create rule management framework
5. Develop rule testing tools
6. Add conflict detection
7. Optimize performance
8. Write comprehensive tests

## Dependencies
- Current rule engine
- LLM provider
- Python AST for DSL parsing
- Rule storage backend

## Estimated Complexity
**High** - Rule DSL design is complex, LLM integration requires careful prompt engineering

## Innovation Highlights

1. **Natural Language Rules**: "When user age is less than 18, reject with message 'Too young'"
2. **Automatic Test Generation**: LLM generates test cases from rule definitions
3. **Smart Conflict Resolution**: Detect and suggest resolutions for conflicting rules
4. **Rule Performance Profiling**: Identify slow rules automatically

## Notes
- Rule DSL should be backwards compatible with lambda-based rules
- Consider rule compilation for performance
- Add rule analytics (most violated, slowest, etc.)
- Document rule authoring best practices
